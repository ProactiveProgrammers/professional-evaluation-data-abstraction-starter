## Learning Objectives

A proactive programmer studying **discrete structures** should demonstrate the
mastery of these learning objectives in the categories of **mathematical
communication**, **rigorous programming**, and **effective communication**.
According to [Robert Talbert](https://rtalbert.org/), a [learning
objective](https://rtalbert.org/how-to-write-learning-objectives/) must be "a
clear, measurable action that a student should be able to do once the lesson is
over". For the purposes of this site, these learning objectives are not for a
specific lesson but rather an entire course for either an Allegheny College
student or, for the duration of self-paced learning, all other emerging
proactive programmers.

### Algorithm Engineering

TODO: Make sure that you assess your own achievement of the learning outcome at
the lowest level of detail. For instance, you should start with "Correctly
implement a data structure" and then go to the end of the learning objective,
press enter, and then rank yourself by adding a number from 1 to 5 and then
furnish a justification for this ranking. For the listing of learning objectives
that start with "Leveraging knowledge of existing data structures ..." you
should rank yourself for each of the individual learning objectives starting
with "Specify the input, output, and behavior ..." in the context of the
containing prompt. Again, you should go to the end of the learning objective,
press enter, and then rank yourself by adding a number and a justification.

- Correctly implement a data structure, such as a stack, list, or dictionary,
  ensuring that it provides all of the functionality required by the structure's
  specification.
- After importing an existing implementation of a data structure (e.g., a list
  or a dictionary), confirm that it provides the required functionality and
  integrate it into an existing program.
- Adapt an existing implementation of a data structure so that it offers
  additional and/or different functionality not provided by that structure's
  standard implementation.
- Leveraging knowledge of existing data structures like a list or dictionary:
    - Specify the input, output, and behavior of functions for a new data
      structure.
    - Design, implement, and document all functions of a new data structure.
    - Implement, execute, and maintain a test suite for a new data structure and
      demonstrate that, for particular input, its behavior matches the
      specification.
    - Integrate the new data structure with the data structures used by an
      existing program.
    - Document the trade-offs associated with the implementation of the new data
      structure, comparing and contrasting it with existing alternatives and
      justifying the need for the bespoke implementation instead of those that
      are already available.
- Use the principles of object-oriented programming (i.e., encapsulation,
  inheritance, and polymorphism) to design, implement, document, and test
  classes that provide all of the features required by the specification of a
  data structure and the algorithms that process it.
- Use exception handling techniques to ensure that the implementation of a data
  structure does not inappropriately crash when it runs in non-standard
  execution circumstances.
- Given input from the file system, network, or console, input the data values,
  store them in a data structure like a list, and then implement and use a
  sorting algorithm like merge sort to order the list of values. Using the same
  list of values, implement and use a search algorithm that can either find a
  specific value in the list or confirm that the value is not in the list.
- Given a finite input and solution constraints, use a dynamic programming
  technique to efficiently solve an instance of an optimization problem (e.g.,
  the 0/1 Knapsack Problem).

### Algorithm Evaluation

TODO: Make sure that you assess your own achievement of the learning outcome at
the lowest level of detail. For instance, you should start with "Characterize
the number of basic operations" and then go to the end of the learning
objective, press enter, and then rank yourself by adding a number from 1 to 5
and then furnish a justification for this ranking.

- Given the psuedo-code description of an algorithm that processes and/or
  manipulates a data structure, perform the following steps as part of its
  analytical evaluation:
    - Characterize the number of basic operations in both iterative and
      recursive algorithms.
    - Use the asymptotic notation and the characterization of its basic
      operations to classify an algorithm as belonging to a well-known
      worst-case time complexity class.
    - Using an algorithm's worst-case time complexity, compare and contrast it
      with other algorithms that have similar and different time complexities,
      explaining which algorithm is most appropriate depending on, for instance,
      the likely size of a program's input.
    - Describe ways in which it is possible to re-design an algorithm and the
      way in which it processes a data structure so as to improve its worst-case
      time complexity.
    - Explain how the algorithm exhibits trade-offs between its worst-case time
      complexity and the amount of space that it needs to store the data
      structure.
- Given the Python-based implementation of a data structure and the algorithm
  that processes and/or manipulates it, perform these steps as part of its
  empirical evaluation:
    - Implement a benchmarking framework that repeatedly executes an algorithm
      through a doubling experiment in which the size of the input repeatedly
      doubles.
    - Use the benchmarking framework to run a doubling experiment for an
      algorithm, computing the doubling ratio for execution time at each stage
      of a benchmark.
    - Use the computed doubling ratio to experimentally predict the likely
      worst-case time complexity class to which the data structure and algorithm
      belong.
    - Leveraging both the likely worst-case time complexity and the experimental
      data reported from the doubling experiment run by the benchmarking
      framework, describe ways in which it is possible to re-design the
      algorithm to improve its performance.
    - Using the likely worst-case time complexity and the experimental data,
      explain how the algorithm trades-off between time efficiency and the space
      needed for data storage.
- For the implementation of a data structure and its associated algorithms in
  the Python programming language, use the results from both the analytical and
  empirical evaluation to:
    - Confidently classify the algorithm according to its worst-case time
      complexity.
    - Identify strengths and weakness in terms of both time and space
      efficiency.
    - Suggest ways to improve the efficiency of the Python implementation.

### Data Analysis

TODO: Make sure that you assess your own achievement of the learning outcome at
the lowest level of detail. For instance, you should start with "Input, process,
check, and clean" and then go to the end of the learning objective, press enter,
and then rank yourself by adding a number from 1 to 5 and then furnish a
justification for this ranking.

- Given one or more sets of textual, numerical, categorical, and/or combined
  data that describe the performance of an algorithm or data structure,
  implement, test, use, and evaluate functions that perform data analysis
  through these steps:
    - Input, process, check, and clean the data sets to confirm their
      correctness.
    - Run an appropriate statistical technique (e.g., the calculation of a mean,
      median, or standard deviation) to summarize and analyze the data.
    - Use an appropriate data visualization technique that can create graphs and
      diagrams that highlight the salient properties of the data set (e.g., show
      the general trends in the data set while drawing attention to the
      dispersion of values).
    - Use statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to surface
      trends in a data set.
    - Implement and use an appropriate data processing method that transforms
      the data into any format required by any external functions (e.g., convert
      from JSON to CSV).

## Rigorous Programming

A person learning data abstraction with the mindset of a proactive programmer
will be able to demonstrate mastery of the following programming skills:

### Python Programming

TODO: Make sure that you assess your own achievement of the learning outcome at
the lowest level of detail. For instance, you should start with "Has function
and variable names that adhere to an industry-standard ..." and then go to the
end of the learning objective, press enter, and then rank yourself by adding a
number from 1 to 5 and then furnish a justification for this ranking.

- Write short Python functions of ten to twenty lines that have the following
  characteristics:
    - Has function and variable names that adhere to an industry-standard
      coding style.
    - Has descriptive comments for module definition and both the function's
      declaration and the function's code that adhere to an industry-standard
      coding style.
    - Features a source code format that adheres to an industry-standard coding
      style.
    - Passes an automated test suite, written with an industry-standard
      framework such as [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/), showing that it
      correctly implements the specification for the function.
    - Has an automated test suite, written with an industry-standard framework
      such as [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/), that covers at least the 80%
      of the statements and branches in the function.
    - Performs the specified operation in an efficient fashion, as determined
      through experiments that evaluate the function's performance in seconds
      or milliseconds.
    - Correctly uses assignment statements, iteration constructs, conditional
      logic, function invocation, and function recursion in a way that passes
      the function's test suite, works efficiently, and conveys the intended
      function's purpose in a Pythonic fashion.
    - Correctly uses a data structure like a dictionary in a way that passes
      the test suite, works efficiently, and conveys the intended purpose of
      the data structure.
    - Correctly performs file and console input and output, ensuring that all
      input and output is displayed and stored correctly, is not corrupted, and
      is processed efficiently.
    - Correctly performs calculations for statistical properties of a data set
      (e.g., the mean, median, and standard deviation), while also clearly
      displaying the data, its relevant summarization values, and the
      interpretation of all statistical properties.
  - Write correct Python programs consisting of between one and five hundred
    lines of source code that correctly solve problems using data structures
    like a list or dictionary.
  - Uses the features of the Python programming language to create classes and
    instances of these classes that solve problems using the principles of
    object-oriented programming.

### Programming Tools

TODO: Make sure that you assess your own achievement of the learning outcome at
the lowest level of detail. For instance, you should start with "Install,
upgrade, and use ..." in the context of containing prompt. You should go to the
end of the learning objective, press enter, and then rank yourself by adding a
number from 1 to 5 and then furnish a justification for this ranking.

- Use a Python programming environment to complete these tasks while
  implementing a Python program consisting of between one and five hundred lines
  of code:
    - Install, upgrade, and use [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.8, 3.9, or
      3.10 programming environment to create, run, and debug a Python program
      through a terminal window and/or a text editor.
    - Use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to install a Python program's
      dependencies, create a virtual environment, and run it without error in an
      isolated and self-contained configuration.
    - Use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run, in an isolated container and
      without error, a Python program, an automated test suite, and automated
      grading tools such as
      [GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader).
    - Use and create a test suite implemented with
      [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) to detect a failure in a Python program
      and then effectively use tools like a text editor and a terminal window to
      find and fix the fault, ultimately confirming that the Python program no
      longer contains the fault and that the fix did not compromise other
      functions in the program.
    - Use a text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to
      implement, test, debug, document, and manage the source code of a Python
      program, leveraging plugins and extensions to enhance your workflow.

### Version Control

TODO: Make sure that you assess your own achievement of the learning outcome at
the lowest level of detail. For instance, you should start with "Clone a GitHub
repository ..." in the context of containing prompt. You should go to the end of
the learning objective, press enter, and then rank yourself by adding a number
from 1 to 5 and then furnish a justification for this ranking.

- Use the [GitHub](https://github.com/) platform and the
  [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system in the following fashion:
    - Clone a GitHub repository without error using either a command in a
      terminal window or an extension for Git integration in a text editor like
      VS Code.
    - Write short and descriptive commit messages that explain the specific way
      in which a commit changes the source code and documentation in the GitHub
      repository.
    - Use GitHub [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure that all
      of the source code, technical writing, and commit messages adhere to the
      industry standards for content and format.
    - Navigate reports produced by [GitHub
      Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) so as to determine which
      aspects of a GitHub repository do and do not adhere to a project's
      specification.
    - Use the [GitHub Flow model](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
      to implement specific features in a branch of a GitHub repository and
      then merge that branch to the main one only after all the checks run by
      GitHub Actions pass as required and code reviews confirm the code's
      correctness.
    - Create and discuss programming and technical writing issues through the
      use of the [GitHub Issue
      Tracker](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com/issues)
      and the [GitHub Discussion
      Forum](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com/discussions),
      furnishing descriptive titles and problem descriptions that adhere to
      industry best practices and project templates.
    - Submit completed projects that pass all of the instructor-provided and
      industry-standard checks, as evidenced through the report of a passing
      build by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Technical Communication

TODO: Make sure that you assess your own achievement of the learning outcome at
the lowest level of detail. For instance, you should start with "In the correct
public channel ..." in the context of containing prompt. You should go to the
end of the learning objective, press enter, and then rank yourself by adding a
number from 1 to 5 and then furnish a justification for this ranking.

A person learning data abstraction with the mindset of a proactive programmer
will be able to demonstrate mastery of the following technology-mediated
communication skills:

- Use [Discord](https://discord.com/) to effectively communicate about
  technology in the following fashion:
    - In the correct public channel, post a question that includes source
      code segments, screenshots, and a description of the steps taken in an
      attempt to solve a problem.
    - Answer questions that were posted in a public channel, responding with
      source code segments, screenshots, and links to external references,
      pointing the proactive programmer who asked the question in the right
      direction without solving the problem for them and limiting their
      opportunity to learn more about the topic in question.
    - Proactively offer to help others who may need to learn scientific,
      mathematical, or technical knowledge and skills that a learner has already
      mastered by sharing the acquired knowledge or skill, how you can be
      contacted, and how you can best assist.

## Opportunities for Improvement

### Your Professional Improvement Plan

TODO: Please write at least two paragraphs that explain the steps that you plan
to take to improve your overall mastery of the technical knowledge and skills
developed as a part of the Data Abstraction course. Your professional
improvement plan should explain SMART (i.e., Specific, Measurable, Achievable,
Relevant, and Time-Bounded) steps that you plan to take to improve your
technical knowledge and skills during the remainder of the Spring 2022 semester.
Please make sure that you clearly explain why your goals are SMART!

## Suggestions for Improving the Learning Objectives

TODO: Please write at least one paragraph that explains the ways in which the
course instructor and/or the student technical leaders can, for instance,
improve the statement of the learning outcomes, improve teaching in a way that
makes it more possible for you to attain and demonstrate mastery of the learning
outcomes, remove or modify the existing learning outcomes, or add new learning
outcomes. You may also share any other feedback for improving learning in
the field of Data Abstraction.
